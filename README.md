# audio-cf

## Environment

Use Python 3.12 on Linux for the GPU serving environment. Python itself cannot
be installed from `requirements.txt`; create and manage the environment with
Conda.

Create a fresh environment and install all project dependencies with:

```bash
conda create --name audio-cf python=3.12 -y
conda activate audio-cf
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the least host-specific setup, use the official `vllm/vllm-openai` Docker
image. See the [vLLM GPU installation guide](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/installation/gpu/)
for current wheel, driver, and container options.

## Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
